# checkin-memory
This is a simple heartbeat server using memory storage

The purpose of this project is to view at a high level devices which are "alive" and their health. As the server will be RESTful, there is no one way to submit heartbeats.

## What this is not
A fully featured network monitoring tool. I intended to create something fairly lightweight and easy to deploy
